## LLM usage

- I used Cursor IDE to write the code for this assignment.
  - Cursor has Cursor Tab functionality that auto completes lines and functions.
  - I used it while coding for all files.
  - It uses a mix of LLMs including GPT-4, Claude, Deepseek and Gemini.
  - I used the pro tier of Cursor.
- I used ChatGPT with the `gpt-4o` model to write:
  - test cases in `dbg_test.go` file.
